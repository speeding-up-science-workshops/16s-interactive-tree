This repository contains code for visualizing an interactive phylogenetic tree

The code can be executed by clicking on the binder link. You can also upload your own data to binder, so you use our code for yourself, without installing any of the needed software. All you need is a web browser. Note that any changes you make will not be saved, so if you want to keep anything, so be sure to download any changes you make.

RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/devonorourke/sus19mb/Niel?urlpath=rstudio)


This visualizations is presented as a R scripts so when you open the binder, it will look like RStudio. The script you want can be opened from the files tab in the lower right of RStudio.
